This are some DDL scripts I've created in order to automatically
parttition zabbix 2.x tables when using postgresql 9.2+

This code is somewhat based on an existing howto at zabbix's website:
 https://www.zabbix.org/wiki/Docs/howto/zabbix2_postgresql_autopartitioning

However, a few gotchas has been fixed (like race condition during child
table creation), and another minor features has been added (like weekly
partitioning support), etc.
